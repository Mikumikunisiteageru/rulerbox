# rulerbox

rulerbox is a LaTeX package providing macro `\rulerbox`, which draws rulers along edges of an object.

## Usage

The basic syntax is `\rulerbox{<content>}` or `\rulerbox[<edges>]{<content>}`, where `<edges>` is any subset of `t` (top), `b` (bottom), `l` (left), and `r` (right). The default `<edge>` is `tblr`.
